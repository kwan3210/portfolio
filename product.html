                        <p>Fittable is a smart table top that allows user to develop good study habits to support good posture through positive reinforcement. The product uses an interactive token system to encourage students to stretch and take active breaks while studying. The activity meter on table top encourages movement by providing real time feedback on current postural status. It is designed for students  who are a particularly high-risk group for sedentary behaviour, which can have negative long-term health consequences. </p><br>

                        <p>The use of Fittable is simple and easy to use. Before you begin your study session, place a small stack of tokens around your study space. For example, you may place one on your bed or on on a shelf. After you finish placing them up, you may start studying! The closest of these tokens will light up when you should take an active break, which signals that you should pick it up and put it on the table. The tabletop activity meter will change according to how active your movement is. When the tabletop senses inactivity the bar will stop growing and the tabletop will vibrate to notify that you should shift your body position to participate in an active break.</p>

                        <p> The project successfully attracted a variety of audience and encouraged them to take active breaks during the simulation. The team was able to successfully achieve our objectives, with all members of the public undertaking postural shift adjustments and active breaks throughout study sessions during demonstrations and feeling motivated or encouraged to do so. The most successful part of the project is that users purely enjoyed the interaction with the tokens. Generally, users liked the idea of placing the tokens wherever they want and how these tokens prompt them to move around. </p>

                        <p> Through user testing,  we found that all users understood, appreciated and engaged with our concept, with an estimated 83% success rate in the area of learnability (well above our target of 60%). We could also estimate that usability to be at a similarly acceptable level. Some criterias were unable to test including efficiency and the full token system for learnability due to technical difficulties on the day due to the Wifi troubles. This limitation however did not result in negative user experience as team could explain how the functions would work.
