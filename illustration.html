                        <p>My personal logo is something that I have been developing ever since I took Graphic Design course at UQ in 2018. I developed initial version of my logo, and have been refining it until now. Because personal identity plays great role in establishing the first impression, I used it sparingly in my business card, website, and printed portfolios. </p>

                        <h2>Graphic Design Portfolio | 2018 </h2>
                        <p>Delivered as part of the Graphic Design course at UQ, 
                        the assessment required us to create a portfolio booklet that documents 
                        and explains the work I've created in the course. The portfolio introduces
                        myself as a designer, provide visuals and explanatory text for each work produced.
                              My effort was rewarded with a High Distinction grade.
                            The full PDF version of Portfolio can be viewed here.

                        <h2>Queensland Youth Week Art Competition | 2020</h2>

                        <p>Teenagers and young adults today often separate people into categories by their age, appearance, gender, school (Private / public), University (UQ / QUT), fashion (e-boys / VSCO girl etc..), ethnicity, cultural background and body shape (big / skinny).  
It can be difficult for us to understand each other because we all have different values and beliefs. For example, a 14-year-old Chinese girl Jennie, who goes to public high school may not fully understand a 17-year-old Australian boy Tom, who goes to private high school. <br><br>

However, even though we are different, we are the in the category of YOUTH. And we cannot deny the fact that the existence of each other empowers the youth and community. Even though we don’t fully understand each other, we feel empowered just by standing up together. Young people have so many potentials and energy that can bring positive impacts to the society. <br><br>

In my artwork, I tried to represent how young individuals unite together and empower other youth living in Queensland to connect and grow together. Regardless of how they look and dress, they are being connected by painting arts and putting posters on the wall for empowering our youth to be future leaders in Queensland. Once we are all connected, we can make changes together and let our voice be heard for issues like climate change and equal education.
